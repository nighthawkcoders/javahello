# Hello Series
Hello, World! Additionally, a variety of classroom and technical hellos.

# Purpose (AP CSA Hello)
* Foundation in social media using Slack, Padlet and Zoom.
* Establishing (a digital) relationship with your Pair/Trio team member(s), project team, and teacher.
* Foundation in Java coding using [Repl.it](https://repl.it/login).
* Using and Understanding [AP CSA Course Requirements](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a)
* Installing future foundational technical tools for class, namely: IntelliJ IDE. GitHub Version Control.  
* Establishing assesment and grading practices. Learning about Sprints and Deliberables. 

## Project (ASCII/Unicode Art Project)
Read each Java file, in this "Monkey Jumpers" sample project
* Read all the comments
* Look closely at comments for exploration ideas 

Further explorations are required, you are to set some goals as a project team and get approval from teacher on your goals as you form a Project Plan.  Each Friday you will have a project deliverable.

Grading criteria is based on [AP Computer Science A Computational and Thinking Practices: Skills Page 23](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a) (CaTP) and [21st century skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century_skills).  Rubric is equally divided amongst the following.
* Program, Design, Logic, Implementation - CaTP 1, 2, 3: documentation of goals prior to implementaton, code meeting technical goals.
* Presentation, Testing - CaTP 4, 5: Evidence showing completenes.  ability to run, procedures or video showing how to run and execute, organization, comments, documentation
* 21st century skills:  communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity
* Intangibles: participation, active learner, being proactive, genuine effort, positve attitude 
Note: Grading will be highly influenced by project team and individuals initial assesment.


## Overview of provided Code
Here is overview of files for "Monkey Jumpers" sample:
* Main.java: Menu for the project.  Start learning Java.
* Printy.java: Learn about and how to print or output to console ASCII/Unicode characters.
* Loopy (Loopy): Learn some fundamentals of imperative or procedural programming.
* Classy.java (Classy): Learn basics of object-oriented programming (OOP).
